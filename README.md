# ProcessesDistributionEvolutionaryAlgorithm

In this reposity I used an evolutionary algorithm to distribute multiple processes on multiple computers in the most efficent way possible(by an EA).

This is how the graph of one run looks (x axis - number of generations, y axis - time needed to run all processes):
